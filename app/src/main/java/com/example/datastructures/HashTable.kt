package com.example.datastructures

//Its a data strycture which stores data in a associate manner. Data is stored in array format where each data valaue has its onw unique index value. Access of data becomes ver fast
// Hash table uses array as a storage medium and uses hash functions(technique)
//to generate and index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from

//Hashing : its a technique to convert a range of keys value into a range of indexes of an array. We use modulo operetar
//to get the range of key values. (module is mostly done by taking the size of the list) to find the correct location

//if with hashing we get same kwy to store value -> we use linear probing (in which we search for the next empty index)

//nce we create a hash value of some data, we can never retrieve data back from that hash value

//put
//get
//add
